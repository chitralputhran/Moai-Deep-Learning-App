# :moyai: Moai | Deep Learning Application

This is a web application made with the help of Flask, a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2, and good intentions. On the backend, a deep learning model (ResNet-50) is classifying the given image file into various categories.

ResNet-50 is a convolutional neural network that is trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database. The network is 50 layers deep and can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals. As a result, the network has learned rich feature representations for a wide range of images. The network has an image input size of 224-by-224.
